% \begin{abstract}

% We intend to create a interactive Crowd Simulation application using the approach described in \cite{kim2012interactive}. The user will be able to interact with the application with a commodity depth sensor \cite{Zhang:2012:MKS:2225053.2225203}, modifying the environment in real time.

\section{Problem}

Since the


\section{Goals}

We intend to implement a Global Structure from Motion technique to reconstruct scenes from photos. We will use the techniques described by \cite{rotation} and \cite{translation}. If we run into time constraints, we will use the code for \cite{rotation} (which is available online) and we will implement the translation correction ourselves. We intend to use our implementation with a large dataset obtained from the internet.
